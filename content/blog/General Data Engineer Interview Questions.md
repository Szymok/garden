3) List various types of design schemas in Data Modelling
There are mainly two types of schemas in data modeling: 1) Star schema and 2) Snowflake schema.

4) Distinguish between structured and unstructured data
Following is a difference between structured and unstructured data:

Parameter	Structured Data	Unstructured Data
Storage	DBMS	Unmanaged file structures
Standard	ADO.net, ODBC, and SQL	STMP, XML, CSV, and SMS

scaling	Schema scaling is difficult	Scaling is very easy.
5) Explain all components of a Hadoop application
Following are the components of Hadoop application:

Hadoop EcoSystem and Components
Hadoop Common: It is a common set of utilities and libraries that are utilized by Hadoop.
HDFS: This Hadoop application relates to the file system in which the Hadoop data is stored. It is a distributed file system having high bandwidth.
Hadoop MapReduce: It is based according to the algorithm for the provision of large-scale data processing.
Hadoop YARN: It is used for resource management within the Hadoop cluster. It can also be used for task scheduling for users.
6) What is NameNode?
It is the centerpiece of HDFS. It stores data of HDFS and tracks various files across the clusters. Here, the actual data is not stored. The data is stored in DataNodes.

7) Define Hadoop streaming
It is a utility which allows for the creation of the map and Reduces jobs and submits them to a specific cluster.

8) What is the full form of HDFS?
HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System.

9) Define Block and Block Scanner in HDFS
Blocks are the smallest unit of a data file. Hadoop automatically splits huge files into small pieces.

Block Scanner verifies the list of blocks that are presented on a DataNode.

10) What are the steps that occur when Block Scanner detects a corrupted data block?
Following are the steps that occur when Block Scanner find a corrupted data block:

1) First of all, when Block Scanner find a corrupted data block, DataNode report to NameNode

2) NameNode start the process of creating a new replica using a replica of the corrupted block.

3) Replication count of the correct replicas tries to match with the replication factor. If the match found corrupted data block will not be deleted.
11) Name two messages that NameNode gets from DataNode?
There are two messages which NameNode gets from DataNode. They are 1) Block report and 2) Heartbeat.

12) List out various XML configuration files in Hadoop?
There are five XML configuration files in Hadoop:

Mapred-site
Core-site
HDFS-site
Yarn-site
13) What are four V’s of big data?
Four V’s of big data are:

Velocity
Variety

File System Check or FSCK is command used by HDFS. FSCK command is used to check inconsistencies and problem in file.

20) Explain Snowflake Schema
A Snowflake Schema is an extension of a Star Schema, and it adds additional dimensions. It is so-called as snowflake because its diagram looks like a Snowflake. The dimension tables are normalized, that splits data into additional tables.

21) Distinguish between Star and Snowflake Schema
Star	SnowFlake Schema
Dimensions hierarchies are stored in dimensional table.	Each hierarchy is stored into separate tables.
Chances of data redundancy are high	Chances of data redundancy are low.

34) How to define the distance between two nodes in Hadoop?
The distance is equal to the sum of the distance to the closest nodes. The method getDistance() is used to calculate the distance between two nodes.

35) Why use commodity hardware in Hadoop?
Commodity hardware is easy to obtain and affordable. It is a system that is compatible with Windows, MS-DOS, or Linux.

36) Define replication factor in HDFS
Replication factor is a total number of replicas of a file in the system.

37) What data is stored in NameNode?
Namenode stores the metadata for the HDFS like block information, and namespace information.

38) What do you mean by Rack Awareness?
In Haddop cluster, Namenode uses the Datanode to improve the network traffic while reading or writing any file that is closer to the nearby rack to Read or Write request. Namenode maintains the rack id of each DataNode to achieve rack information. This concept is called as Rack Awareness in Hadoop.

39) What are the functions of Secondary NameNode?
Following are the functions of Secondary NameNode:

FsImage which stores a copy of EditLog and FsImage file.
NameNode crash: If the NameNode crashes, then Secondary NameNode’s FsImage can be used to recreate the NameNode.
Checkpoint: It is used by Secondary NameNode to confirm that data is not corrupted in HDFS.
Update: It automatically updates the EditLog and FsImage file. It helps to keep FsImage file on Secondary NameNode updated.
40) What happens when NameNode is down, and the user submits a new job?
NameNode is the single point of failure in Hadoop so the user can not submit a new job cannot execute. If the NameNode is down, then the job may fail, due to this user needs to wait for NameNode to restart before running any job.
41) What are the basic phases of reducer in Hadoop?
There are three basic phases of a reducer in Hadoop:

1. Shuffle: Here, Reducer copies the output from Mapper.

2. Sort: In sort, Hadoop sorts the input to Reducer using the same key.

3. Reduce: In this phase, output values associated with a key are reduced to consolidate the data into the final output.

42) Why Hadoop uses Context object?
Hadoop framework uses Context object with the Mapper class in order to interact with the remaining system. Context object gets the system configuration details and job in its constructor.

We use Context object in order to pass the information in setup(), cleanup() and map() methods. This object makes vital information available during the map operations.

43) Define Combiner in Hadoop
It is an optional step between Map and Reduce. Combiner takes the output from Map function, creates key value pairs, and submit to Hadoop Reducer. Combiner’s task is to summarize the final result from Map into summary records with an identical key.

44) What is the default replication factor available in HDFS What it indicates?
Default replication factor in available in HDFS is three. Default replication factor indicates that there will be three replicas of each data.

45) What do you mean Data Locality in Hadoop?
In a Big Data system, the size of data is huge, and that is why it does not make sense to move data across the network. Now, Hadoop tries to move computation closer to data. This way, the data remains local to the stored location.

46) Define Balancer in HDFS
In HDFS, the balancer is an administrative used by admin staff to rebalance data across DataNodes and moves blocks from overutilized to underutilized nodes.

47) Explain Safe mode in HDFS
It is a read-only mode of NameNode in a cluster. Initially, NameNode is in Safemode. It prevents writing to file-system in Safemode. At this time, it collects data and statistics from all the DataNodes.

48) What is the importance of Distributed Cache in Apache Hadoop?
Hadoop has a useful utility feature so-called Distributed Cache which improves the performance of jobs by caching the files utilized by applications. An application can specify a file for the cache using JobConf configuration.

Hadoop framework makes replica of these files to the nodes one which a task has to be executed. This is done before the execution of task starts. Distributed Cache supports the distribution of read only files as well as zips, and jars files.

49) What is Metastore in Hive?
It stores schema as well as the Hive table location.

Hive table defines, mappings, and metadata that are stored in Metastore. This can be stored in RDBMS supported by JPOX.

50) What do mean by SerDe in Hive?
SerDe is a short name for Serializer or Deserializer. In Hive, SerDe allows to read data from table to and write to a specific field in any format you want.

51) List components available in Hive data model
There are the following components in the Hive data model:

Tables
Partitions
Buckets
52) Explain the use of Hive in Hadoop eco-system.
Hive provides an interface to manage data stored in Hadoop eco-system. Hive is used for mapping and working with HBase tables. Hive queries are converted into MapReduce jobs in order to hide the complexity associated with creating and running MapReduce jobs.

53) List various complex data types/collection are supported by Hive
Hive supports the following complex data types:

Map
Struct
Array
Union
54) Explain how .hiverc file in Hive is used?
In Hive, .hiverc is the initialization file. This file is initially loaded when we start Command Line Interface (CLI) for Hive. We can set the initial values of parameters in .hiverc file.

55) Is it possible to create more than one table in Hive for a single data file?
Yes, we can create more than one table schemas for a data file. Hive saves schema in Hive Metastore. Based on this schema, we can retrieve dissimilar results from same Data.

56) Explain different SerDe implementations available in Hive
There are many SerDe implementations available in Hive. You can also write your own custom SerDe implementation. Following are some famous SerDe implementations:

OpenCSVSerde
RegexSerDe
DelimitedJSONSerDe
ByteStreamTypedSerDe
57) List table generating functions available in Hive
Following is a list of table generating functions:

Explode(array)
JSON_tuple()
Stack()
Explode(map)
58) What is a Skewed table in Hive?
A Skewed table is a table that contains column values more often. In Hive, when we specify a table as SKEWED during creation, skewed values are written into separate files, and remaining values go to another file.

59) List out objects created by create statement in MySQL.
Objects created by create statement in MySQL are as follows:

Database
Index
Table
User
Procedure
Trigger
Event
