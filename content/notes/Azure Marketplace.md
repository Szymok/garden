## Azure Marketplace

- Think of it like an “Azure Shop” where you purchase services and solutions for the Azure platform
- Each product is a template which contains one or multiple services
- Products are delivered by first and third-party vendors
- Solutions can leverage all service categories like IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
