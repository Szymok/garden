Julia is a high-level, general-purpose, high-performance,
cross-platform, dynamic programming language originally
designed for numerical and scientific computing.
Julia is open-source under the MIT license.
Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, Jeff Bezanson, and Professor Alan
Edelman (MIT) created Julia in 2012.
