# Netflix Original Research: MIT CODE 2023

Netflix was thrilled to be the premier sponsor for the 2nd year in a row at the 2023 Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODE@MIT).

## Highlights

## Note

**Contents of the Webpage:**

- Netflix was the premier sponsor for the 2023 Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODEMIT) in Cambridge, MA. 
- The conference featured a blend of academic and industry research. 
- Talks and posters were presented on various topics related to AB testing and experimentation. 
- The concept of surrogates in AB tests was discussed, focusing on measuring long-term outcomes using short-term surrogates in the presence of bias. 
- Surrogate index models were evaluated for product decision making, showing that shorter tests can lead to reliable decisions without waiting for months for results. 
- A new framework called Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) was presented, which provides a holistic evaluation for AB tests by appropriately weighting different engagement metrics. 
- Martin Tingley discussed the challenges in digital experimentation and how they differ from agricultural research. 
- Partial identification of the dose-response function (DRF) was explored as a method to provide more insightful analyses of experimental data. 
- The CODEMIT community bonded over their shared enthusiasm for rigorous measurement in experimentation. ## Note
