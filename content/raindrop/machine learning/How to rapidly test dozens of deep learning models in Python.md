# How to rapidly test dozens of deep learning models in Python

Letâ€™s develop a neural network assembly line that allows us to easily experiment with numerous model configurations.

## Highlights

## Note

- The webpage discusses the importance of being able to quickly test and experiment with different model configurations in order to optimize machine learning (ML) models and maximize productivity in ML projects. 
- It explains that deep learning models are governed by a set of hyperparameters, and lists the primary hyperparameters that govern neural networks. 
- The webpage provides a function that can be used to construct and compile neural networks based on a given set of hyperparameters. 
- It mentions that after evaluating over a dozen model architectures with 5-fold cross validation, it was discovered that deeper and wider architectures are necessary to obtain high performance on the data, likely due to the non-linear structure of the data. ## Note
