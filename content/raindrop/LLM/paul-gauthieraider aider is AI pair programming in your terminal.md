## Highlights
## Note

Aider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with GPT-3.5/GPT-4, to edit code stored in your local git repository. You can start a new project or work with an existing repo. Aider makes sure edits from GPT are committed to git with sensible commit messages. Aider is unique in that it lets you ask for changes to pre-existing, larger codebases.
